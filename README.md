# Indian-Vehicle-Info-With-Captcha-Verification
This is a java and python program which can bypass the captcha of and get user information from the site: VAHAN-NIC

Logic:
1. Firstly downloading the captcha
2. Secondly cracking it with tesseract 
3. Using selenium to interact and fill keys
4. Getting and displaying the data

There are sites on the internet which do this job and don't ask for the captcha. It can used with data extraction to make it faster.

You may use tess4j for java and write a java program for OCR.
